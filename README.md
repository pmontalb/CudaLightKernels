# CudaLightKernels

This API is a collection of common CUDA kernels calls that I use in my programs. This is by no means a fully-fledged library. It simplifies the code and it reduces the overhead in calling native CUDA code.

This library should be changed not too often, so that once the binary is compiled, it can be paired with a manager for being used in different programming languages.
